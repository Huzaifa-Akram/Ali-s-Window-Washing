      <h3>Mistake #2: Cleaning in Direct Sunlight</h3>
      <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> Cleaning solutions dry too quickly, leaving streaks and residue.</p>
      <p><strong>The Solution:</strong> Clean windows during cooler parts of the day or on overcast days.</p>

      <h3>Mistake #3: Using Household Cleaners</h3>

      <p><strong>The Solution:</strong> Use specialized window cleaning solutions or simple soap and water.</p>

      <p><strong>The Solution:</strong> Follow proper ladder safety protocols or hire professionals.</p>
